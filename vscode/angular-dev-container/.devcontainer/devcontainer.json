	//Create node_modules when start in order to mount it with the docker volume for caching node dependencies
	//If you delete the node_modules folder in the container, it may lose the connection to the volume. Delete the contents of the node_modules folder instead when needed (rm -rf node_modules/* node_modules/.*).
	//You'll find that an empty node_modules folder gets created locally with this method. This is because the volume mount point in the container is inside the local filesystem bind mount. This is expected and harmless.
